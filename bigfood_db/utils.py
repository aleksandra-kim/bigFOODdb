def create_location_mapping(db1, db2_name):
    """
    Create mapping between unlinked exchanges of database `db1` and their corresponding activities in `db2`.
    Here an exchange in `db1` needs to be linked to activity in `db2` with location `GLO`, which does not exist there.
    Instead, there are activities with the same name but different locations, which constitute GLO location together.
    For example, CH + DE + RoW = GLO, where Rest of the World (RoW) basically adds whatever locations are missing to
    result in GLO. Hence, the mapping is from unlinked exchanges of `db1` and list of activities in `db2` with same name
    but multiple locations.
    Example: (market for lime, GLO) is split by production volume into
             (market for lime, RoW) & (market for lime, RER).
    Mapping is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary corresponds to an unlinked exchange.
    The key is the index of the unlinked exchange in `db`` and the values are `db2` activities codes.
